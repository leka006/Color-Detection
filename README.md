# Color Detection using OpenCV

This project is a real-time color detection tool built using Python and OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam and detects 20 different colors live on the screen. Each color is shown with a bounding box and label.

---

## What It Does
- Detects 20 colors from your webcam video feed.
- Draws boxes around the detected colors.
- Labels the color name on the video stream.
- Works well under different lighting using HSV color space.

## How It Works

- The script converts each video frame to HSV color space.
- It applies color masks to find areas with a specific color.
- It detects contours for those areas and draws bounding boxes.
- The color name is displayed on top of the box.
